I see green walls in your background. Sensed that you are called to step out in faith to pray for the sick and heal them in Jesus Name. I sensed that you have a hunger to see people healed and saved. I believe that the All authority in heaven and earth is already yours (Matthew 28:18, Mark 16:20)


I hear this song.. I will exalt you...my hiding place, the scared one. I hear God singing over you that he is your hiding place in the storm.

Hi, This song comes to mind: Way Maker, Miracle worker, promise keeper, light in the darkness. I feel like God wants to reveal Himself to you in various ways, like expand the ways how you view Him. In the song they also sing: Even when I don't see it you're working. I want to encouge you with the truth that God is Always working. He does not forget you. Even when you don't see it, He holds you in His hand, He loves you and He is for you.

I got this song for you…Good Father
I feel like God wants you to make sure He is your father who cares for you

HI there I heard " Father I thank you" by Jeremy Camp for you. I believe that GOd is giving you glorious victory over all your giants!


I see you are so hungry that God keeps feeding you - never lose that hunger

I got a sense of chives for you.  It’s a combination of refreshing, savory, and a little horseradish like.  You’re uniquely multifaceted.
